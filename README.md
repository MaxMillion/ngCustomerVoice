# ngCustomerVoice

Small Angular.js provider for sending feedback, Q&A and support for your application. It can be used as replacement for [Intercom](https://www.intercom.io) or [Uservoice](https://www.uservoice.com/) messaging plugins.

### Install

ngCustomerVoice is a simple angular provider and directive based on [ngDialog](http://likeastore.github.io/ngDialog/) popups. So for proper work you can install it through [Bower](http://bower.io/) package manager (recommended):

```bash
bower install ngCustomerVoice
```

And don't forget to include all necessary javascript and css files to your application:

- ``ngDialog.css``
- ``ngCustomerVoice.css``
- ``angular.js``
- ``ngDialog.js``
- ``ngCustomerVoice.js``

### Usage

To start using plugin you just need to insert **directive** into your template:

```html
<div ng-customer-voice="'your.user@email.com'"></div>
```

You are able to insert some identifier of a user (email, username, id, etc.) but it's optional, this can be handled on your server instead.

And inside your app configuration  use ``ngCustomerVoiceProvider`` to specify which API url will be requested:

```js
var app = angular.module('YourApp', ['ngDialog', 'ngCustomerVoice']);
app.config(['ngCustomerVoiceProvider', function (ngCustomerVoiceProvider) {
	ngCustomerVoiceProvider.apiUrl('/your/email/server');
}]);
```

That's it!
